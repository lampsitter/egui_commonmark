## Parsing backends

egui_commonmark offers __experimental__ support for using [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak)
as parsing backend. By default pulldown_cmark is used. To use comrak instead do:

```toml
egui_commonmark = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["load-images", "comrak"] }
```

### Why two parsing backends?

egui_commonmark was originally implemented using pulldown_cmark, however comrak
has stricter commonmark/github style markdown support. In addition it allows the
crate to support more features than pulldown_cmark can offer with regards to github
style markdown.

pulldown_cmark has fewer dependencies and should theoretically be faster.

Due to these reasons both backends are supported. At least for now.


### Differences in support

Currently both support the same feature set

### Known rendering differences

| Type    | pulldown_cmark | comrak |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Footers | Placed when they appear | Placed at the end |
| Spec incompatibilities | Blocks such as images can be rendered inside tables. This is against the spec | Disallowed |
