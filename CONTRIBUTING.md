## How to contribute

First of all thank you for considering it. Check out
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of how the repo is put together.

### Running tests

You won't be able to run the tests without enabling the `macros` feature
as one of the examples depend on it.

`cargo test --feature macros`


### Debugging the proc macros

To see the output of the macros enable the `dump-macro` feature.
For the macro example the output can be viewed like this:

```sh
cargo r --example macro --features dump-macro,macros -- dark | rustfmt --edition=2021 | less
```
