# Architecture

## Crates

- `egui_commonmark`
- `egui_commonmark_macros`
- `egui_commonmark_backend`

### egui_commonmark

This is the main crate. It depends on `egui_commonmark_backend` and can expose
`egui_commonmark_macros` through the `macros` feature.

### egui_commonmark_macros

This is a proc macro crate. It depends on `egui_commonmark_backend`

### egui_commonmark_backend

This is a crate that contains all code shared between the egui_commonmark
crates. The code in this crate is also used by the code generated by
`egui_commonmark_macros`. As a result the visibility of most items in it is `pub`
by default. Since a user should not directly rely on these APIs most elements
are hidden from the documentation.

`egui_commonmark` reexports some of it's items. So care must be taken to ensure
that no implementation details are accidentally exposed.
